<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Phillip Salas.  Im going to school at EBHS and im the class of 2021.I had a rough time growing up as my mom being a single parent. She always pushed me to do my best in everything. I played football for 3yrs intil i found out that i had a synus disease in my head that cause me to have migranes. I had to take pills for a month but the doctor told me to drink lots of water because i can get stones in my kidneys. But before that I went to Stiern Middle School highschool. I broke my wrist on the last day of school by playing basketball. I never really had a serious injury but there was one injury that hurt the most was when i pulled my hamstring at football practice when i was running a route and pulled it. We had a game that week against the knights. And told them i still wanted to play with my injury that i had. </p>
<p>It was very hard as a kid. What I want to do in the future is be an engineer or a basketball player . The colllege i want to go to is Arizona because i always dreamed to go to Arizona because my stepdad is a arizona fan for football and basketball. </p>
 <p> And thats all about me hope u enjoyed</p></body>
